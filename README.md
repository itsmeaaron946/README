for BB+

watch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=510CzRHrXT4&t=8s] for tutorial, then do it the same for expanded level editor.
Notes more help: if your plugins folder didnt pop up, you downloaded the wrong BepInEx. 
                dont download the public release version, download the newest version.
